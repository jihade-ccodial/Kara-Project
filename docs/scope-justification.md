## Important Note on HubSpot Marketplace Requirements

**⚠️ HubSpot Requirement**: HubSpot's marketplace guidelines state: *"Your app must use all of the scopes that it requests during installation. Scopes that are not used must be removed."*

**Recommendation**: 
- Before submitting to the HubSpot Marketplace, implement functionality that uses all requested scopes, OR
- Consider using conditional/optional scopes if HubSpot supports them for future features, OR
- Remove unused scopes for initial submission and add them back when implementing the features

**Current Status**: These scopes are included for future development but should be implemented before marketplace submission to comply with HubSpot requirements.

## Scope Minimization

Kara follows the principle of scope minimization:
- **Only Required Scopes**: We request only the scopes necessary for functionality
- **No Overreach**: We do not request scopes for data we don't use
- **Justified Usage**: Every requested scope has clear usage in the codebase
- **Documented**: All scopes are documented with usage examples

## Compliance

- ✅ Currently used scopes are documented and justified
- ⚠️ Some scopes are requested for future use (see note above)
- ✅ Scope usage is documented with current and planned usage
- ✅ Scopes follow HubSpot's best practices
- ⚠️ **Action Required**: Implement functionality for all requested scopes before marketplace submission
